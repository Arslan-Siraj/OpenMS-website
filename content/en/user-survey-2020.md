In 2020, the openms survey team in partnership with students and faculty from a
Masterâ€™s course in Survey Methodology jointly hosted by the University of
Michigan and the University of Maryland conducted the first official openms
community survey. Over 1,200 users from 75 countries participated to help us
map out a landscape of the openms community and voiced their thoughts about the
future of the project.
