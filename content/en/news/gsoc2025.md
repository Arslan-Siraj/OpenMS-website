ðŸŽ‰ OpenMS is part of GSoC 2025 â€“ Two Projects Accepted!

We're thrilled to announce that two OpenMS projects have been accepted for Google Summer of Code 2025! ðŸš€
A big thank you to everyone who took the time to submit a proposal. Your enthusiasm and creativity are what make open-source thrive.
This yearâ€™s GSoC was extremely competitive, with:
ðŸ“Œ 15,240 applicants from 130 countries
ðŸ“Œ 23,559 proposals submitted
ðŸ“Œ 185 mentoring organizations (including OpenMS!)
ðŸ“Œ 2,350+ mentors and admins
ðŸ“Œ And notably, 66.3% of applicants were completely new to open source â€“ an incredible stat that reflects the growing impact of this program.
We're proud to be part of this global community, and weâ€™re looking forward to working with our selected contributors on advancing open mass spectrometry software.
