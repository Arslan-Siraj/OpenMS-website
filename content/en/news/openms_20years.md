OpenMS was first announced in an abstract for the HUPO fourth Annual World Congress published in Molecular and Cellular Proteomics on 1 August 2005. The OpenMS team invites everyone who has contributed to OpenMS to a BBQ in the garden of Sand at Tübingen University. We estimate that over a hundred individuals have contributed time to OpenMS and we invite all of you to celebrate this milestone.
