_Some information about the OpenMS project and community_

OpenMS is an open-source software C++ library for LC-MS data management and analyses. It offers an infrastructure for rapid development of mass spectrometry related software. OpenMS is free software available under the three clause BSD license and runs under Windows, macOS, and Linux. OpenMS will always be 100% open source software, free for all to use and released under the liberal terms of the [modified BSD license](https://github.com/openms/openms/blob/main/License.txt).

With pyOpenMS, OpenMS offers Python bindings to a large part of the OpenMS API to enable rapid algorithm development. OpenMS supports the Proteomics Standard Initiative (PSI) formats for MS data. The main contributors of OpenMS are currently the Eberhard-Karls-Universität in Tübingen, the Freie Universität Berlin, and the ETH Zürich.
