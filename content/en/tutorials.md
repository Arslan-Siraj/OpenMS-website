This tutorial was designed to guide you through the use of our Community Contributions to the KNIME workflow system. It contains:

- installation instructions,
- a very small introduction to TOPPView in case you want to additionally install the OpenMS binaries for visualisation,
- a basic introduction to KNIME and its graphical user interface
- a guide to construct example workflows for proteomics, metabolomics, quality control …
- a guide to the Python bindings pyOpenMS and DIA with OpenSWATH
- a small “OpenMS in KNIME” Troubleshooting guide with an FAQ

## TOPP/TOPPView Tutorial

For use with the binary installers of OpenMS. It describes how to use the OpenMS TOPP tools from the command line and has an extensive tutorial on visualisation with TOPPView. You need your own data to work through it. In case you do not have any, have a look at the data from the User Tutorial above.
