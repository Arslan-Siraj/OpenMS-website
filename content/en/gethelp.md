**User questions:** The best way to get help is to post your question to a site
like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=openms), with
thousands of users available to answer.  Smaller alternatives include
[Gitter](https://gitter.im/openms/openms). We wish we could keep an eye on
these sites, or answer questions directly, but the volume is just a little
overwhelming!

**Development issues:** For openms development-related matters (e.g. bug reports), please
see [Community](/community).



### [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=openms)

A forum for asking usage questions, e.g. "How do I do X in openms?‚Äù. Please [use the `#openms` tag](https://stackoverflow.com/help/tagging)

***

### [Gitter](https://gitter.im/openms/openms)

A real-time chat room where users and community members help each other.
