openms is a community-driven open source project developed by a diverse group of [contributors](/teams/). The openms leadership has made a strong commitment to creating an open, inclusive, and positive community. Please read the [openms Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) for guidance on how to interact with others in a way that makes the community thrive.

We offer several communication channels to learn, share your knowledge and connect with others within the openms community.


## Participate online

The following are ways to engage directly with the openms project and community.
_Please note that we encourage users and community members to support each other
for usage questions - see [Get Help](/gethelp)._


### [openms mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/openms-discussion)

This list is the main forum for longer-form discussions, like adding new features to openms, making changes to the openms Roadmap, and all kinds of project-wide decision making.
Announcements about openms, such as for releases, developer meetings, sprints or
conference talks are also made on this list.

On this list please use bottom posting, reply to the list (rather than to
another sender), and don't reply to digests. A searchable archive of this list
is available [here](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/openms-discussion@python.org/).

***

### [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/openms/openms/issues)

- For bug reports (e.g. "`np.arange(3).shape` returns `(5,)`, when it should return `(3,)`");
- documentation issues (e.g. "I found this section unclear");
- and feature requests (e.g. "I would like to have a new interpolation method in `np.percentile`").

_Please note that GitHub is not the right place to report a security vulnerability. If you think you have found a security vulnerability in openms, please report it [here](https://tidelift.com/docs/security)._

***

### [Slack](https://openms-team.slack.com)

A real-time chat room to ask questions about _contributing_ to openms.
This is a private space, specifically meant for people who are hesitant to
bring up their questions or ideas on a large public mailing list or GitHub.
Please see
[here](https://openms.org/devdocs/dev/index.html#contributing-to-openms) for more
details and how to get an invite.


## Study Groups and Meetups

If you would like to find a local meetup or study group to learn more about openms and the wider ecosystem of Python packages for data science and scientific computing, we recommend exploring the [PyData meetups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/pydata/) (150+ meetups, 100,000+ members).

openms also organizes in-person sprints for its team and interested contributors occasionally. These are typically planned several months in advance and will be announced on the [mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/openms-discussion) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/openms_team).


## Conferences

The openms project doesn't organize its own conferences. The conferences that have traditionally been most popular with openms maintainers, contributors and users are the SciPy and PyData conference series:

- [SciPy US](https://conference.scipy.org)
- [EuroSciPy](https://www.euroscipy.org)
- [SciPy Latin America](https://www.scipyla.org)
- [SciPy India](https://scipy.in)
- [SciPy Japan](https://conference.scipy.org)
- [PyData conferences](https://pydata.org/event-schedule/) (15-20 events a year spread over many countries)

Many of these conferences include tutorial days that cover openms and/or sprints where you can learn how to contribute to openms or related open source projects.


## Join the openms community

To thrive, the openms project needs your expertise and enthusiasm. Not a coder? Not a problem! There are many ways to contribute to openms.
