openms is a community-driven open source project developed by a diverse group of [contributors](/teams/). The openms leadership has made a strong commitment to creating an open, inclusive, and positive community. Please read the [openms Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) for guidance on how to interact with others in a way that makes the community thrive.

We offer several communication channels to learn, share your knowledge and connect with others within the openms community.


## Participate online

The following are ways to engage directly with the openms project and community.
_Please note that we encourage users and community members to support each other

### [openms mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/openms-discussion)

This list is the main forum for longer-form discussions, like adding new features to openms, making changes to the openms Roadmap, and all kinds of project-wide decision making.
Announcements about openms, such as for releases, developer meetings, sprints or
conference talks are also made on this list.

On this list please use bottom posting, reply to the list (rather than to
another sender), and don't reply to digests. A searchable archive of this list
is available [here](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/open-ms-general/).
