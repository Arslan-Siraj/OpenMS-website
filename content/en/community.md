### [Gitter](https://gitter.im/OpenMS/OpenMS)

A real-time chat room to ask questions about _contributing_ to OpenMS.
This is a private space, specifically meant for people who are hesitant to
bring up their questions or ideas on a large public mailing list or GitHub.

***

### [Discord](https://discord.gg/aJyWqf6uCn)

Similar to Gitter, Discord allows the users to communicate in different channels, publicly as well as privately

***

### [OpenMS mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/open-ms-general/)

This list is the main forum for longer-form discussions, like adding new features to OpenMS, making changes to the OpenMS Roadmap, and all kinds of project-wide decision making.

Announcements about OpenMS, such as for releases, developer meetings, sprints or
conference talks are also made on this list.

On this list please use bottom posting, reply to the list (rather than to
another sender), and don't reply to digests. A searchable archive of this list
is available [here](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/open-ms-general/).
